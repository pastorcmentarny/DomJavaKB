Hi Dominik,

I wanted to get in touch as I am partnered with a well-regarded consultancy based in the heart of London that are working with a diverse portfolio of organisations, and after looking over your LinkedIn profile I thought you may be a great fit. My Client works with eCommerce brands, well known car brands, Fintech start-ups and a wide range of private and public sector clients.

They are recruiting for a Lead and Senior Consultant on permanent contracts. You would be expected to utilise your expertise in Java and DevOps to work on solutions and overcome problems for the variety of organisations my client works with. My client is a bit of a hidden gem when it comes to consultancy's, as they have the unique structure of working within their own team instead of going into the organisational structure. My client also has a great culture, which has been cultivated by the CTO, but when people do leave, typically they move into positions within company's of the likes of Amazon, google or Facebook, which shows the calibre they are working at.

- Mostly Remote working (Post Covid)
- Excellent Salary Range for both the Lead and Senior position
- Great Benefits package

Let me know if you'd like to hear more, as I can be contacted on LinkedIn or you can call me on 0203 9407464.
