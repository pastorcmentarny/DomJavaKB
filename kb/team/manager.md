# Being Manager Tricks and TRAPS

0. Seagull manager: "Seagull managers fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, and then fly out. The signs of the
   seagull manager:
    - mass emails about the critical issues, even if they are really minors or there is the slight risk of the issue.
    - Late night calls on very-very-very critical bug.
0. When the PM can’t manage priorities he looks more like the fireman – solving the issues when they rise and 100% of
   time devote to the urgent tasks.
0. Don't assume developers are coding 8 hours a day? Take into account:
    - the holidays
    - workshops
    - some team members are shared between the several projects.
    - the newly formed team can’t start working with the full productivity from day 1?
    - meetings
    - event
    - support
0. Project plans they create are the same distance from the reality as the person who claims to control weather. As long
   as we:
    - Get the work done
    - Deliver what we say
    - Keep growing our clients' businesses
0. Managers sit in meetings to help understand higher-level company objectives. They remove roadblocks so their teams
   can continue creating.

   It’s really important for remote leaders to set rules around how, when, and which communication tools to use when working in virtual teams.
   What’s on your mind this week?
   Last time we spoke, you said X was a challenge for you. How is that going?

## Personal Goals

Say this: Over the past three quarters, I have exceeded my sales goals by X%. I know that if I were able to work remotely one day a week I could increase that number to X because of the flexibility my remote schedule would create. Working remotely once a week would also give me the ability to attend a professional development class in the morning, and work in the evenings when I am more productive.
What are your plans and priorities for this week?
How aligned do you feel with where the company is going?
What feedback do you have for me?
