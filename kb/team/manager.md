 #Manager Tricks and TRAPS
* Seagulll manager: “Seagull managers fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, and then fly out.”The signs of the seagull manager:mass emails about the critical issues, even if they are really minors or there is the slight risk of the issue. As we usually have a lot of issues – they always get a chance to say “I warned you about that!”. late night calls on very-very-very critical bug. they are always named among the people who saved the whole thingall talk, no actionwhen they leave your room – you feel totally exhausted, as if it was a tornado or tsunami manager is highly detached from the team.What is the status? What are you doing?” are his favorite questions.
* When the PM can’t manage priorities he looks more like the fireman – solving the issues when they rise and 100% of time devote to the urgent tasks.
* Don't assume developers are coding 8 hours a day? Take into account the holidays, workshops, some team members are shared between the several projects.vthe newly formed team can’t start working with the full productivity from day 1? A new developer joining a team start performing like an old one after studying the project for 1 day? Hmm, we are in trouble…
 short term plans as close to the actual implementation of your software as possible, while keeping long term plans as flexible as possible.
But project plans they create are the same distance from the reality as the person who claims to control weather. 
As long as we:
- Get the work done
- Deliver what we say
- Keep growing our clients' businesses
