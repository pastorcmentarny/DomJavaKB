Channel naming
We use a basic Slack naming convention to keep things organized.

#team- : Where cross-functional teams discuss their work.
#zone- : Zones are a collection of EPD teams with common goals or areas of the product.
#initiative- : Each year, we have main initiatives we are tackling, and there is a channel for each initiative.
#wg- : Where working groups on specific projects discuss their work.
#guild- : Where a group works on an objective. The difference between a #wg and a #guild is their lifetime. Working groups have an end in mind and it should be bounded. Guilds have an evergreen objective.
#feed- : Automatically aggregating posts of various types from different bots.
#fun- : Discussing non-work things, like fitness, books, games, and the like.
#city- : Channels for each city/region/country with multiple Zapiens.
#retreat- : Company and team retreats.
#labs- : Similar to #wg, for discussing early research and development work.
#pb-team: Team pair buddy channels.
#tech-: where we discuss various how-to aspects of technology.
Function channels: Channels like #product, #support, #marketing, etc. are large functional channels that primarily act as triage/routing, announcement, and discussion that affect the entire function.
-clips (typically used as a suffix): Links to important messages from another channel using special reacji.
-technical (typically used as a suffix): Contains technical discussions that may not be needed/appropriate for all stakeholders.
These are some of the important channels and their purpose:

#general: General company announcements and discussion.
#triage: The place to ask when you don't know where to go.
#peopleops: The place to ask HR questions.
#helpdesk: The place to ask internal IT questions, like help getting on the VPN or other computer problems.
#feed-async: Every new Async posts gets published here, and anyone who's been tagged in the post will be @-mentioned.
#feed-zapier-clips: This is where important company-wide announcements end up, so stay tuned here for important updates. Anyone can push any post here by adding the :zapier-clips: emoji to a post.
#fun-celebrations: Celebrate fun milestones, dates, and anniversaries.
#fun-gratitude: A place to express appreciation.
#fun-zapier: General fun stuff.Each channel has a purpose. Do your best to stay on topic.
#pair-buddies: Great way to get to know people around Zapier. Join this channel to get paired with a teammate for a 30-minute Pair Buddy chat, 1x a week.
Use threads as much as possible
We don't use Slack as a place to document important information,
