# WORK FROM HOME/REMOTE WORK
## WORK FROM HOME
1.  Make sure you have a trusty internet connection
2.  Set a hard cut-off time for the day.
    -   From 8.00 to 16.00. I’m happy to chat at lunch, but other than that I’ll be occupied.” Typically, when you set expectations and stick to them (say, really stopping at 5 PM), 
    -   “While at home, I didn’t always have a cut-off time for checking my email or Slack, so it was easy for work to creep into my evenings
3.  Stick to your normal routine
4.  if you work from home only one day a week or on occasion, make it a meeting-free day.

## REMOTE WORK RULES
1.  Set aside time to explore
2.  Travel light, travel comfortably. “The less you travel with, the easier it is to move locations and the quicker you’ll settle into a new spot.”
3.  Coffee shop rules:
    -   Workfrom that lets you scope out places, and the owners of cafes can mark in the app whether or not they welcome coworkers https://workfrom.co/search?g=Rickmansworth%2C+UK
    -   Make Regular Purchases: 
        -   Buy coffee
        -   Then pastry
        -   And so on
        -   Be Friendly
        -   Tip Well
4.  This freedom also requires us to be more disciplined when it comes to working together — particularly when it comes to how we communicate with one another.Setting up a virtual one-to-one>it shoud be around 25 or 50 minutes ( we seldom need to meet for exactly a standard hour.)g, I usually try to send a 5-minute reminder, so that the person I’m set to chat with gets a heads up and can wrap up their current task or call. It is even more important get to know each other better when you do virtual one-to-one. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
5.  Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
6.  People don't have to say when they are working.
7.  Working long hours or weekends is not encouraged nor celebrated.
8.  Encourage teamwork and saying thanks.


this: Working remotely once a week will allow me to dive deeper into the projects that I’m working on, give full attention to my professional goals, and attain the flexibility to work during the hours in which I am most productive.

Say this: Over the past three quarters, I have exceeded my sales goals by X%. I know that if I were able to work remotely one day a week I could increase that number to X because of the flexibility my remote schedule would create. Working remotely once a week would also give me the ability to attend a professional development class in the morning, and work in the evenings when I am more productive. 

To be a successful remote worker, you must be productive when you’re by yourself.

A remote workplace is, essentially, a results-based workplace
Close your laptop and mean it at the end of the day. Work will always be there tomorrow.

Once a week I have “deep work Wednesday”, where I aim to have little to no meetings, and use lengths of unscheduled time to read and reflect on high-level vision and strategy.
