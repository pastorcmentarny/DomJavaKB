# WORK FROM HOME/REMOTE WORK
## WORK FROM HOME
1.  Make sure you have a trusty internet connection
2.  Set a hard cut-off time for the day.
    -   From 8.00 to 16.00. I’m happy to chat at lunch, but other than that I’ll be occupied.” Typically, when you set expectations and stick to them (say, really stopping at 5 PM), 
    -   “While at home, I didn’t always have a cut-off time for checking my email or Slack, so it was easy for work to creep into my evenings
3.  Stick to your normal routine
4.  if you work from home only one day a week or on occasion, make it a meeting-free day.

## REMOTE WORK RULES

4.  This freedom also requires us to be more disciplined when it comes to working together — particularly when it comes to how we communicate with one another.Setting up a virtual one-to-one>it shoud be around 25 or 50 minutes ( we seldom need to meet for exactly a standard hour.)g, I usually try to send a 5-minute reminder, so that the person I’m set to chat with gets a heads up and can wrap up their current task or call. It is even more important get to know each other better when you do virtual one-to-one. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
5.  Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
6.  People don't have to say when they are working.
