# BEING A BETTER DEVELOPER TIPS
1.  Do Root Cause Analysis for mistakes you made. Write down a short description of the bug, the fix, and the lessons I learned. Each case should have a date, how many times it happens, symptoms, caused, fix, lesson learned. Use my blog to do that. 
2.  Fundamentals  -  It’s a lot easier to pick up new skills when you have a real command of the underlying fundamentals. For example, if you understand JavaScript deeply, you can master any new JavaScript framework in record speed. If you know Object Oriented Programming deeply, you can master new object-oriented languages quickly, too. Learning the fundamentals can increase 10x your learning efficiency.
3.  Learning time should be a part of your schedule. Set aside a specific amount of time for learning every day. It doesn’t need to be much time, even 25 minutes of reading and experimentation every day adds up quickly.
4.  When you “find an answer” don't just copy and paste the code that appears to solve a problem. Understand it, because brainlessly copy and paste can make you a worse programmer.
5.  Read Lots of Code when you read remember to ask questions: How would I have written that block of code? What did I learn? How would I improve this code? Write these answers a blog, share code on GitHub or community medium.
6.  Learn How to Avoid Asking Questions. You learn it the “hard way” which is the way that sticks to our memory much better - we’ll remember what we’ve learned. It’s more rewarding to figure stuff out for yourself.
7.  Git merges from developing branch daily.
8.  Use UTC as the only timezone for your servers.
9.  Building context can take hours, only to be lost by a random interruption.
10. Information Security is always flashing their badges at people and making urgent demands, regardless of the consequences to the rest of the organisation, which is why we don’t invite them to many meetings. 
11. We begin with the first available story in Pivotal Tracker. Let’s say that it’s #3275: User Can Add A Comment To a Post. First, check out a feature branch named with the story id and a short, descriptive title: git checkout -b 3275-add-commenting.  The id allows us to easily track this branch back to the story that spawned it. The title is there to give us humans a little hint as to what’s in it.

0 Retry feature enable ability for an application to handle transient failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource, by transparently retrying a failed operation. This can improve the stability of the application.
