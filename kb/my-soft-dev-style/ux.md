# UX

1.  Guidance for Good Human-System Interactions according to Jakob Nielsen are:
    -   Status and communication from the system should always be visible to the user and should use the user's language without technical gibberish. The system should always keep user information about what's going on through non-intrusive feedback.     
    -   The system guides user what to do next and what are consequences. For example. It should prevent a user from making mistakes or at least warn it about possible consequences of the action.
    -   The system should always help the user to recover if shit happens, so If the user makes a mistake, the system should have an ability to emergency stop/exit from the current state. It should explain the error in plain language and provide a possible solution to recover.
    -   The system should be designed enough flexible too for a novice user but should allow an expert user to access to advanced functionality.

2.  Way to Measure Usability of task
    -   Speed - how quickly task can be accomplished
    -   Efficiency - how many mistakes are made in accomplishing the task
    -   Learnability - how easy is to learn to use the system
    -   Memorability - once learned, how easy is to remember how to use the system
    -   User Preference - what do users like?
3.  Always Use Verbs as Button Labels.
4.  Good usability
    -   Simple and natural dialogue.
    -   Speak the user's language.
    -   Minimize memory load (for example multi-step buying process instead of one enormous form).
    -   User constructive error messages.
    -   Support recall.
    -   Make clear exists.
    -   Make shortcuts.
    -   Give feedback (to user about what is going on is good/back/info).
    -   Prevent errors.
    -   Thrive for consistency.
5.  Permission strategy depends on the clarity and importance of the permission type you are requesting. Critical permissions should be requested up-front, while secondary permissions may be requested in-context. Explaining a permission in context is another well-done example — it helps gauge user interest and improve comprehension of the permission. Try to explain to a user the benefits they’ll receive by giving the app access.  providing a background image that explains the permission request. Because denying permissions may prevent a feature from working as intended, whenever a permission is denied it should be explained to the user.A simple rule: You should provide feedback whenever a permission is denied.
6.  A word of caution however, when you need to find language to notify your users of incorrect/incomplete data entry, try to avoid negative trigger words such as “wrong, invalid, and failed” instead try to use positive language like “please try again” or “please fill in a valid postal code.”
7.  Site visitors typically absorb the information on a webpage by an initial horizontal movement, over the page’s upper part. This initial element forms the F’s top bar. Then, visitors usually move their eyes down the page a little bit before reading across in another horizontal movement that’s shorter than the initial one. This additional element forms the F’s lower bar. Finally, users scan the content’s left side in a vertical movement. 
8.  Before You Start…
