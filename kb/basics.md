### E

OO fubctional In an event-driven architecture, components perform activity in response to receiving events and emit events to trigger activities in other components. In an event-sourced architecture, components record a history of events that occurred to the entities they manage, and calculate the state of an entity from the sequence of events that relate to it.

### L 
Locks can make sure that the sequence of language operations are going to be performed in isolation to other concurrent threads working with that same resource. Locks cannot garantee atomicity, which I explained Atomicity, in particular, guarantees that each compound action is treated as a single "unit of work," which either succeeds completely or fails completely. If any of the compound actions constituting a unit of work fails to complete, the entire unit of work fails and the data is left unchanged (Wikipedia). As I have shown in my post, Java cannot guarantee that without adding extra code, like exception handling, to intrinsic and explicit locks. 

### T
0. TCP: It is a reliable data transfer protocol that ensures that the data sent is complete and correct and requires to establish a connection.
