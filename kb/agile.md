# AGILE

Agile is type of software development method based on interactive and incremental development.
* Deliver working software frequently in  short timescale.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
* Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project. As work Business – devlopers ,face-to-face conversation is The most efficient to succes.
* Simplicity (KISS principle)


## DAILY STAND-UP

There are a two ways of doing.
* 45 second per person/pair
* (TODO)The sequence continues from right-to-left, top-to-bottom, people describing what is happening with each of the work items, and others chiming in if they can help resolve obstacles. On the side, the team leader is recording the raised obstacles on the improvement board.

If conversation gets longer than 1 minute, it should be interupted by scrum master/team leader and taken off line.

In the end scrum master/team leader  team leader asks if anyone has anything else to share . (about any event that may happen)

Everybody who wants/need to know about the day-to-day operation of the project should attend the single daily stand-up meeting.

### What to say on stand-up
1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What shall I do today?
3. What obstacles are affecting my progress?
4. Announcement to share (I work shorter as I attend meetup and so on.)

##RETROSPECTIVE

A retrospective
Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
Identify  what went well and wrong and investigate potential improvements; and,
Create a plan for implementing improvements


It should have
Action point assign to specific person to supervision progress.
Rules - a list of things that team should follow and focus on daily basis

Retrospective should have agenda that is known in advance.


Potential problems with retrospective
 * no agenda
 * repeatable formula over and over again.
 * not enough time
 * not learning  from action points from precioua retro; not reviewing them.


What to check on retrospective:
+5 +2  -2 -5

product :
* Are we doing the right stuff at the right time?
* Do we have long term goals and vision for the product?
* How do we measure the value of our product?

architecture:
(TODO)architecture — Do we know how to work with building our architecture? Do we have a vision for it? How often do we need to refactor the code? Why in that way? Are we using the right technology for the product we’re doing?

development :
* How can we deploy more often into production?
* How is our continuous integration approach?
* How can we share our best practices with others?

process:
?

stakeholders — 
(todo)How do we know our stakeholders are content with our work? How can we communicate more efficiently with them?

happiness —
 * What are we proud of as a team?
 * What is stopping us from being better?

Scrum:
* What are practices that we use have become obsolete?
* What could we experiment with in the next sprint?

### Continuous improvement

 Continuous Improvement (CI) is a concept is connected with Kaizen approach which means kai (“change”) zen (“good”) is “improvement”.
 It is evolution process rather than revolution.

 It is ongoing process :
 * to improve  product, process , team , relationship and tools
 *  and adapt to current circumstances and reach the best possible efficiency at the current time.

 This is NOT way to improve efficiency and doing more work in business value sense.
