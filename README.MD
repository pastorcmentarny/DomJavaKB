# **README**

# **WARM WELCOME** fellow citizen

I guess must be lost as there is no other reason to be on this project page. 
I am impressed that in the world of the Github where there are many amazing projects, you are looking for the project that is anti-pattern of programming :).

# **HONEST WARNING**:

* Code quality is shocking and depressing because the purpose of this project is not to write code that is "production awesome".
  * For example. Almost all utils classes are done better by proper libraries like Apache Commons or Guava, but I wrote them to learn and practice TDD.
  * There are many coding styles used through this project because I like to experiment with different libraries, code style a want to see which style is most suitable for me.
  * You may read advice on the internet. Read other people code and learn from it but don't use this project for that :).


# **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

This project contains a collection of tasks, exercises and utils classes that I am writing since 2010.

The main goal is to keep a backup of my learning journey and experiments.
I use this project to:
- learn new things in Java, design patterns and algorithms.
- learn new things in Python.
- practice various development techniques like TDD and refactoring.
- improve my code quality.
- store various code snippet that I used or I would like to use in future.
- write prototypes of various code snippets that I am intended to use in other projects.
- keep kb where i keep best definitions


#SUB-PROJECTS

## BLOG
This project contains code snippets for my notes 

## REVENGER 
This is a simply project that reply for specific API calls
I had idea to do it using Spring Framework but then I realised that for what I need, Python/Flask is enough.


# OTHER INFORMATIONS 

## What is tag-xxx in comment ?
It helps me to find classes and kb files when I want remind myself about something. For example:
* tag-log
* tag-controller


## To analyse dependencies
```./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze```- check dependencies . The reports will be generated automatically under build/reports folder.
