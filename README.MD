# **README**

WARM WELCOME fellow citizen, who I guess must be lost as there is no other reason to be on this project page.
I am impressed that in the world of the Github where there are many amazing project, you are looking on project that is anti-pattern of programming :).

## **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

This is project that contains collection of tasks, exercises and utils classes that I wrote since 2010.

Main goal is to keep backup of my learning journey and experiments.
I use this project to learn new things in Java, design patterns , algorithms and various development techniques like TDD or refactoring.
I use as well to improve my code quality.
I use this project to store various code snippet that I used or I would like to use in future.

### **HONEST WARNING**:
* Code quality is shocking and depressing, because purpose of this project is not to write code "production awesome".
  * For example. Almost all utils classes are done better by proper libraries like Apache Commons or Guava, but I wrote them to learn and practice TDD.
  * There are many coding styles used through this project, because like to experiment with different libraries, code style a want to see which style is most suitable for me.
  * You may read advice on internet. Read other people code and learn from it. Don't use this project for that :).
  
  
Enjoy your time here and if you fancy in contact with me feel free do so.
