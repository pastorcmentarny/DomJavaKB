# **README**

WARM WELCOME fellow citizen, who I guess must be lost as there is no other reason to be on this project page. 
I am impressed that in the world of the Github where there are many amazing projects, you are looking for the project that is anti-pattern of programming :).

## **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

This project contains a collection of tasks, exercises and utils classes that I am writing since 2010.

The main goal is to keep a backup of my learning journey and experiments.
I use this project to:
- learn new things in Java, design patterns and algorithms.
- practice various development techniques like TDD and refactoring.
- improve my code quality.
- store various code snippet that I used or I would like to use in future.
- write prototypes of various code snippets that I am intended to use in other projects.

### **HONEST WARNING**:
* Code quality is shocking and depressing because the purpose of this project is not to write code that is "production awesome".
  * For example. Almost all utils classes are done better by proper libraries like Apache Commons or Guava, but I wrote them to learn and practice TDD.
  * There are many coding styles used through this project because I like to experiment with different libraries, code style a want to see which style is most suitable for me.
  * You may read advice on the internet. Read other people code and learn from it but don't use this project for that :).
