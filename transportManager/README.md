# Transport Manager

A set of microservices to help me track progess of visit tube,train stations in the UK,buses,trams in Wroclaw and trains
in Poland

Main purpose is to have a project that allows me to play with Spring Framework

* **UI** - it is a front end for application
* **Service** - in practice it should be set of services
* **DB** - I could use normal DB like good developer, but I decided to write application that imitate DB written in
  Python.A masterpiece of engineering and proof why you should NOT do it :D

## Useful tools:
