# This is my Spring Framework learning project

It is WORK IN PROGRESS.

I am in the process of merging a few little projects  that i used to learn Spring Framework into one. 
I will do this step by step to merge them nicely and improve project as whole while I do it.
I will use this project to be up to date with all changes that happen to Spring Framework.

### **HONEST WARNING**:
* Code quality is shocking and depressing because the purpose of this project is not to write code that is "production awesome".  
  * There are many coding styles used through this project because I like to experiment with different libraries, code style a want to see which style is most suitable for me.
  * You may read advice on the internet. Read other people code and learn from it but don't use this project for that :).
  
  
Enjoy your time here and if you fancy in contact with me feel free to do so.
