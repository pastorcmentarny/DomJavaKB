# Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0 / However, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:


result = 'abcdefgh'

for character in result:
    print('character:' + character)

print(result[-8], result[-6])  # starts from -1 (last character)

# Lists

print(result)
print(str(result[0]) + "::" + str(result[-5]))

# All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:

result += [36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121]
print(result)

# Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:

result[0] = 2
print(result)
result[0] = 1
result.append(12 ** 2)
print(result)

result[2:5] = []  # remove values for 3,4 and 5th element

var = 128 * 3
print('Value of var is', var)

# ]	Since ** has higher precedence than -, -3**2 will be interpreted as -(3**2) and thus result in -9. To avoid this and get 9, you can use (-3)**2.
